# Comparison of three software to detect alternative splicing events
Output of three software to detect alternative splicing events.

## Abstract

The target of this study is compare three softwares. The main goal of these tools is detect alternative splicing events.
The analized softwares are ASGAL, SplAdder and rMATS. It was important harmonize the input files for each analized software. We used gene annotation file (GTF format), genome reference (FASTA format) and RNA-Seq samples simulated by RNASeqReadSimulator.
We considere the Y chromosome and some easy AS events and some complex AS events.
We suggest reading RelazioneFinale_MattiaPrevitali_807564.pdf to understand what has been done.

## Content

This archive contains the following files:
  1) 3 Python3 scripts to execute the pipelines about each analized software
  2) otuput files for each pipeline executed
  3) 9 files with merged information about outputs of each pipeline to compare the three AS detecting software
  4) genome reference about Y chromosome, in FASTA format
  5) gene annotation about Y chromosome, in GTF format
  6) report of this study, in PDF format
